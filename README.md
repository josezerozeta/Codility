Introduction
============
All tasks are **Codility Limited** ownership. This repository represents my solutions to **Codility Limited** algorithmic tasks. The plan is to solve all the lessons in order lesson, and gradually solve all. All tasks are considered completed only when their performance is optimal, at best possible big O time and space complexity.

Directory structure example
============
<pre>
/Lesson name   # Folder for certain lesson 
    Task1.java       # Task1 solution
    Task2.java       # Task2 solution
    Task3.java       # Task3 solution
</pre>

Every solution has description according to this example:
```java
public class Task {

  public V solution(input){
    // code	
  }
	
  @Test(timeout = 1000)
  public void correctness() {
    // test
  }
    
}
```
